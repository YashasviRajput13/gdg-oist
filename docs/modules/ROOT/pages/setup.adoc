= Local Development Setup
:navtitle: Local Setup

This guide will explain how to get the GDG OIST project running locally on your computer.

== Prerequisites
You will need the following installed:
* Node.js (v18+)
* npm (v9+)

== 1. Installation
First, clone the project and install all top-level runtime dependencies and development tools.

[source,bash]
----
cd gdg-oist-crafted
npm install
----

== 2. Environment Configuration
The project requires environment variables to connect to Supabase.

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project folder:
----
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-project>.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsIn...
----

WARNING: Do not commit your `.env` file! It should remain ignored by Git.

== 3. Running the Development Server
This project uses Vite, which provides incredibly fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

[source,bash]
----
npm run dev
----
The development server will boot up and usually host the website at `http://localhost:5173/` or `http://localhost:8080/`. Changes to the React or Tailwind code will reflect instantly in the browser.

== 4. Building for Production
When it's time to deploy the site (e.g., to Vercel, Netlify, or Github Pages), run:

[source,bash]
----
npm run build
----
This produces an optimized build directory containing minified HTML, CSS, and JS.
