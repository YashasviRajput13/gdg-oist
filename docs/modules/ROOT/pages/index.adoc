= GDG OIST Crafted Website
:navtitle: Welcome

Welcome to the internal engineering documentation for the GDG OIST project!

== Overview
This project is built to power the online presence for Google Developer Group (GDG) at OIST. It handles displaying upcoming events, a dynamic photo gallery, team details, and collecting contact submissions. 

Unlike a static HTML website, this project is fully powered by a modern React frontend and hooked up to a Headless Content Management System (CMS) through Supabase.

== Key Features 🚀
* *Dynamic Content*: Events, Galleries, and Team Members are fetched dynamically on page load.
* *Contact Integration*: The contact form saves submissions directly to a structured database.
* *Beautiful UI*: Built with `framer-motion` for fluid animations and `tailwindcss` for styling.
