= Architecture & Tech Stack
:navtitle: Architecture Details

Our website sits on top of a highly optimized and developer-friendly stack designed for high velocity and scalability.

== Frontend Tools
=== React & Vite
The project uses *React (v18)* for its component-driven View layer, bundled by *Vite*. Vite provides out-of-the-box support for TypeScript and JSX, and is significantly faster than Webpack or Create-React-App.

=== Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui
All layout and design is composed using *Tailwind CSS* utility classes. This removes the need for large, unmaintainable global CSS files. We also leverage reusable component primitives sourced from `shadcn/ui`, such as accordions, buttons, and text inputs.

=== Framer Motion
For micro-animations and smooth scroll-triggered animations (like the Hero and Gallery staggering), the project heavily relies on *Framer Motion*.

== Backend CMS (Supabase)
Instead of hardcoding text or embedding images into the GitHub repository, we treat *Supabase* as our Headless Content Management System.

Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative built natively on PostgreSQL.

Data Flow Architecture:
. Component Mounts (`useEffect`).
. Client queries Supabase using `@supabase/supabase-js`.
. Data is returned via REST and deserialized.
. Component updates React local state, triggering a re-render.

Our Supabase Database instances requires 4 primary tables to function:
* `events`: Stores upcoming and past GDG events.
* `gallery_items`: Stores the rotating masonry gallery image details.
* `team_members`: Holds developer/organizer information and social URLs.
* `contact_submissions`: The sink for Contact form incoming requests.
